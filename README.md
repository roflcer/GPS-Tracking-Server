# GPS-Tracking-Server
The following project is a multithreaded program that handles incoming UDP packets as vehicle location updates, which are generated by a simulator. Each vehicle maintains its own updating thread until time out. This application handles parsing XML requests as well. Viewing these vehicles on a map can also be enabled.
